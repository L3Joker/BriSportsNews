		<section>
            <h2>New Seasons</h2>
            <p>Transfer Budgets and Wage Budgets are allocated based on player managers' positions in the league (using an F1 format). The lowest-ranked manager gets the best budget, while the highest-ranked manager gets the least. These allocations are in addition to what the board provides.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Position</th>
                        <th>Transfer Budget</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>1st</td>
                        <td>£20M</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>2nd</td>
                        <td>£35M</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>3rd</td>
                        <td>£50M</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> These positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd) refer to the standings among player managers, not the overall league table. For example, if the highest-ranked player manager is in 3rd place and the lowest is in 7th place, they are considered 1st and 3rd among player managers respectively.</p>
