                As anticipation builds for the highly awaited Bavarian derby, BriSportsNews Senior Journalist <strong>Hugh Jasswell</strong> reached out to the managers at the center of the storm: Mainz 05‚Äôs <strong>James Devine</strong> and Augsburg‚Äôs <strong>Matthew Brierley</strong>. </p> 
                <p> 
                With both sides boasting strong starts to the season, tensions are running high as the teams prepare to clash at the <strong>MEWA Arena</strong>. Fans from both clubs have taken to social media to express their excitement, and the fixture has been marked as a potential decider in the hunt for supremacy in the region. </p> 
                <div class="quote-section"> 
                    <h2>James Devine's Thoughts üéôÔ∏è</h2> 
                    <div class="quote-image">

                    <blockquote> 
                        "Want some words? Last time we played, I smashed them 3-1 or 4-1. Honestly, I can't remember because Augsburg are just irrelevant to me. Baldy can keep hyping up his 'ferocious' team, but it's hard to be scared of a team that has been missing its new signing of Naldo. That Diddy Disciple has spent more time warming the physios bench than the pitch. If they think they are getting anything from this game, they are as delusional as their manager."

                    <h2>Matthew Brierley's Perspective üéôÔ∏è</h2>

                    <blockquote> 
                        It‚Äôs a very exciting match up, the lads come up short last time but we are ready to show the league why we deserve to add another achievement to our cabinet. 
                        I always expect Mainz to struggle towards the end of the season, the lack of leadership from their manager, the lack of care for his players just proves why they have so many injuries and that they are on the slope of disarray. 
                        I don‚Äôt really listen to the James comments, he try‚Äôs to hide the fact he doesn‚Äôt have a coaching badge, he can‚Äôt even count to ten hence why he gets his assistant to do the squad numbers, so this does not worry me. All good things come to an end. 
                        All I‚Äôll say is that the lads are ready and if we don‚Äôt win it won‚Äôt stop us piling the pressure on Mainz until the very last game.
