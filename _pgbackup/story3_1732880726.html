                Yes ladies and gents, it‚Äôs all headed down to the wire here in the Bundesliga! With 5 matches left to be played, it‚Äôs been a 3-horse race all season long, but unfortunately for Werder Bremen this looks like it‚Äôs between 2 teams‚Ä¶ </p> 
                <div class="story-section"> 
                    <div class="story-image left">

                    <p> 
                    In the Blue corner we have the well-experienced <strong>Matthew Brierley</strong>, fresh off a 1-0 win against Werder Bremen they have closed the gap down to just a single point on Mainz! It seems the young lad Lamine Yamal is an avid BriSports News viewer as since our latest post he‚Äôs been on red-hot form! But the question is, do Augsburg have it in them to make one final push with their busy fixture list?! </p>

                    Aaandddd in the red corner we have your current league leaders Mainz 05, led by <strong>James Devine</strong>. It seems all season we‚Äôve watched James‚Äô side and they‚Äôve been unbeatable! But since their first loss in 28 league games to Werder Bremen, it seems the ship became a little unstable! Recently dropping all 3 points to a struggling FC Koln side agonisingly in the dying moments of the match, however with the white gummy enthusiast seemingly prioritising the league over cup competitions, could we see them go all the way!? </p>

                Well that all depends on‚Ä¶ </p> 
                <h2>THE FINAL DERBY OF THE SEASON!!</h2> 
                <p> 
                That‚Äôs right! Mainz 05 and Augsburg go HEAD to HEAD, TONIGHT, and the words are on everyone‚Äôs lips. Whoever comes out victorious will be lifting that glorious Bundesliga trophy in a 5 weeks time! </p>
