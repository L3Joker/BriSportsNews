            <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
            <p>
                Yes, ladies and gents, that‚Äôs correct! The teams have had a few weeks off, and now they all look fit and ready for the new season ahead!
            </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <p>
                Starting with <strong>Augsburg</strong>, fresh off a treble-winning season! We saw them battle all the way to the end, toppling the mighty Mainz right at the end of the season, which saw them lift the Bundesliga title! And to add to their trophy cabinet, they destroyed RB Leipzig in the final of the Pokal!
            </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 3 with image -->
            <div class="story-section">

                </div>
                <p>
                    But there was one team they couldn‚Äôt beat in the final‚Ä¶ <strong>Werder Bremen</strong>! The champions of Europe! Manager Jack Apted was quoted saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never sing that.‚Äù Another positive season for the green and whites, who add the most prestigious trophy to their cabinet. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be looking to add a few more this season üëÄ.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
            <p>
                And finally, we go over to <strong>Mainz 05</strong>. In what was ultimately a disappointing season for the 05ERs, after leading the Bundesliga for the majority of the season, they found themselves slipping to 3rd. There‚Äôs been murmurs among fans, with some joking they did it for the budget! All jokes aside, we at BriSports News are sure manager Devine will be hungry for a trophy this season to catch up to his competitors.
