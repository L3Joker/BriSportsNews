                    The League has started to heat up! At the top we have <strong>Marvellous Mainz</strong> continuing their incredible unbeaten run! And with 2 games in hand, they look set to win the division‚Ä¶ can they keep this up until the final day to become the invincibles? üëÄ
                </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 2 with image on the right -->
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>
                    Up next we have <strong>Astounding Augsburg</strong>, despite a rocky start to the season they‚Äôve slowly begun to find their feet again towards the top of the table. Can the Bundesliga holders claw their way back to the top of the table?

                <p>
                    And finally, we have <strong>Woeful Werder</strong>. All jokes aside, they currently sit in a comfortable 4th place in the Bundesliga table and have already qualified for the round of 16! Not to mention their amazing signing of <strong>Erling Haaland</strong> on a 6-month loan! They go up against league leaders <strong>Mainz 05</strong> in a few weeks. Can they derail the league leaders?
