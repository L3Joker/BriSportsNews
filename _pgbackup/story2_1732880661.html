                <h1>Mainz Boat Rocked, Augsburg Steady, and Haaland Out!</h1> 
                <p> 
                Things have really taken a turn in the Bundesliga since our last look! </p> 
                <p>  <strong>Mainz</strong> boat has been rocked by the mighty Werder Bremen, led by young manager Jack Apted! Taking a 3-0 loss on the road to the green and whites, things haven‚Äôt gotten much easier for the white gummy enthusiast. With injuries to his WHOLE front line, can he pull mighty Mainz out of the trenches to clinch onto the Bundesliga title!? </p> 
                <p> 
                Over in <strong>Augsburg</strong>, Manager Sky Bet Bri has continued his good form, seemingly using Messi in a new role to try and get the best from the players around him. One player who‚Äôs struggled for form this season is 17-year-old <strong>Lamine Yamal</strong>. With just 5 goals and 2 assists in 20 games, the Spaniard really needs to step up his form or risks having his starting place pulled from underneath him! </p> 
                <p> 
                And finally, to touch on <strong>Werder Bremen</strong>, they‚Äôve been quietly plodding along over the course of the last few months, finally winning a derby! Thanks to the help of 6-month loanee <strong>Erling Haaland</strong>. Unfortunately, Jack Apted will be without the big Norwegian for 6 weeks due to an ankle injury and, in his own words, ‚Äúunfortunately has to rely on Danny Welbeck‚Äù once again! </p> 
                <p>
